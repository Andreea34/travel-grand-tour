    <p>
      Published accounts of the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> provided illuminating detail and an often polished first&ndash;hand perspective of the experience. Examining some accounts offered by authors in their own lifetimes, <span class="testimonial author">Jeremy Black</span> detects the element of literary artifice in these and cautions that they should be approached as travel literature rather than unvarnished accounts. He lists as examples <span class="testimonial author">Joseph Addison</span>, <span class="testimonial author">John Andrews</span>, <span class="testimonial author">William Thomas Beckford</span> (whose <cite class="testimony source">Dreams, Waking Thoughts, and Incidents</cite> was a published account of his letters back home in <time datetime="1780">1780</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1781">1781</time>, embellished with stream&ndash;of&ndash;consciousness associations), <span class="testimonial author">William Coxe</span>, <span class="testimonial author">Elizabeth Craven</span>, <span class="testimonial author">John Moore</span>, tutor to successive dukes of Hamilton, <span class="testimonial author">Samuel Jackson Pratt</span>, <span class="testimonial author">Tobias Smollett</span>, <span class="testimonial author">Philip Thicknesse</span>, and <span class="testimonial author">Arthur Young</span>.

      Although <span class="country">Italy</span> was written as the <q class="testimony quote">sink of iniquity</q>, many travelers were not kept from recording the activities they participated in or the people they met, especially the women they encountered. To the <i lang="en">Grand Tourists</i>, <span class="country">Italy</span> was an unconventional country, for <q class="testimonial quote">The shameless women of Venice made it unusual, in its own way.</q> <span class="testimonial author">Sir James Hall</span> confided in his written diary to comment on seeing <q class="testimonial quote">more handsome women this day than I ever saw in my life</q>, also noting <q class="testimonial quote">how flattering Venetian dress [was] &mdash; or perhaps the lack of it</q>.

    <p>
      <time datetime="1700">Eighteenth</time> and <time datetime="1800">nineteenth century</time> Italian women, with their unfamiliar methods and routines, were opposites to the western dress expected of European women in the <time datetime="1700">eighteenth</time> and <time datetime="1800">nineteenth century</time>; their "foreign" ways led to the documentation of encounters with them, providing published accounts of the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i>.

    <p>
      <span class="testimonial author">James Boswell</span> courted noble ladies and recorded his progress with his relationships, mentioning that Madame Micheli <q class="testimonial quote">Talked of religion, philosophy... Kissed hand often.</q> The promiscuity of Boswell's encounters with Italian elite are shared in his diary and provide further detail on events that occurred during the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i>. Boswell notes <q class="testimonial quote">Yesterday morning with her. Pulled up petticoat and showed whole knees... Touched with her goodness. All other liberties exquisite.</q> He describes his time with the Italian women he encounters and shares a part of history in his written accounts.

      <span class="testimonial author">Lord Byron</span>'s letters to his mother with the accounts of his travels have also been published. Byron spoke of his first enduring Venetian love, his landlord's wife, mentioning that he has <q class="testimonial quote">fallen in love with a very pretty Venetian of two and twenty — with great black eyes — she is married &mdash; and so am I &mdash; we have found & sworn an eternal attachment... & I am more in love than ever... and I verily believe we are one of the happiest unlawful couples on this side of the Alps.</q> Many tourists enjoyed sexual relations while abroad but to a great extent were well behaved, such as <span class="testimonial author">Thomas Pelham</span>, and scholars such as <span class="testimonial author">Richard Pococke</span>, who wrote lengthy letters of their <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> experiences.

      Inventor <span class="testimonial author">Sir Francis Ronalds</span>' journals and sketches of his <time datetime="1818">1818</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1820">20</time> tour to Europe and the Near East have been published online. The letters written by sisters Mary and Ida Saxton of Canton, Ohio in <time datetime="1869">1869</time> while on a six&ndash;month tour offer insight into the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> tradition from an American perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
      Immediately following the American Civil War U.S. author and humorist <span class="testimonial author">Mark Twain</span> undertook a decidedly modest yet greatly aspiring "<i lang="en">grand tour</i>" of Europe, the Middle East, and the Holy Land, which he chronicled in his highly popular satire <cite class="testimony source">Innocents Abroad</cite> in <time datetime="1867">1867</time>. Not only was it the best&ndash;selling of Twain's works during his lifetime, it became one of the best&ndash;selling travel books of all time.
