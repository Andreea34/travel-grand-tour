        The itinerary of the <em>Grand Tour</em> was not set in stone, but was subject to innumerable variations, depending on an individual's interests and finances, though <span class="city">Paris</span> and <span class="city">Rome</span> were popular destinations for most English tourists. The most common itinerary of the <em>Grand Tour</em> shifted across generations, but the British tourist usually began in <span class="city">Dover</span>, <span class="country">England</span>, and crossed the English Channel to <span class="city">Ostend</span> in <span class="country">Belgium</span>, or to <span class="city">Calais</span> or <span class="city">Le Havre</span> in <span class="country">France</span>. From there, the tourist &mdash; usually accompanied by a <span class="entourage guide">tutor</span> (known colloquially as a <dfn class="entourage guide">bear&ndash;leader</dfn>) and, if wealthy enough <span class="entourage staff">a troop of servants</span> &mdash; could rent or acquire a <span class="transportation">coach</span> (which could be resold in any city &mdash; as in Giacomo Casanova's travels &mdash; or disassembled and packed across <span class="site">the Alps</span>), or he could opt to make the trip by <span class="transportation">riverboat</span> as far as <span class="site">the Alps</span>, either travelling up <span class="site">the Seine</span> to <span class="city">Paris</span>, or up <span class="site">the Rhine</span> to <span class="city">Basel</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Upon hiring a French&ndash;speaking guide, as <span class="language">French</span> was the dominant language of the elite in Europe during the <time datetime="1600">17th</time> and <time datetime="1700">18th centuries</time>, the tourist and his <i lang="fr">entourage</i> would travel to <span class="city">Paris</span>. There the traveller might undertake <span class="activity">lessons in French</span>, <span class="activity">dancing</span>, <span class="activity">fencing</span>, and <span class="activity">riding</span>. The appeal of <span class="city">Paris</span> lay in the sophisticated language and manners of French high society, including courtly behavior and fashion. This served to polish the young man's manners in preparation for a leadership position at home, often in government or diplomacy.
      </p>

      <p>
        From <span class="city">Paris</span> he would typically sojourn in urban <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, often in <span class="city">Geneva</span> (the cradle of the Protestant Reformation) or <span class="city">Lausanne</span>. <dfn class="activity">Alpinism</dfn> or mountaineering developed later, in the <time datetime="1800">19th century</time>. From there the traveller would endure a difficult crossing over <span class="site">the Alps</span> (such as at <span class="site">the Great St Bernard Pass</span>), which required dismantling the <span class="transportation">carriage</span> and larger luggage. If wealthy enough, he might be <span class="transportation">carried over the hard terrain</span> by <span class="entourage staff">servants</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once in <span class="country">Italy</span>, the tourist would visit <span class="city">Turin</span> (and sometimes <span class="city">Milan</span>), then might spend a few months in <span class="city">Florence</span>, where there was a considerable Anglo&ndash;Italian society accessible to travelling Englishmen <q>"of quality"</q> and where the <i lang="it">Tribuna</i> of the <span class="site">Uffizi gallery</span> brought together in one space the monuments of <span class="site">High Renaissance paintings</span> and <span class="site">Roman sculpture</span>. After a <span class="activity">side trip</span> to <span class="city">Pisa</span>, the tourist would move on to <span class="city">Padua</span>, <span class="city">Bologna</span>, and <span class="city">Venice</span>. The British idea of <span class="city">Venice</span> as the <q>"locus of decadent Italianate allure"</q> made it an epitome and cultural set piece of the <em>Grand Tour</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        From <span class="city">Venice</span> the traveller went to <span class="city">Rome</span> to <span class="activity">study the ancient ruins</span> and the masterpieces of painting, sculpture, and architecture of Rome's Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque periods. Some travellers also visited <span class="city">Naples</span> to <span class="activity">study music</span>, and (after <time datetime="1750">the mid&ndash;18th century</time>) to appreciate the recently discovered archaeological sites of <span class="city"><i lang="la">Herculaneum</i></span> and <span class="city"><i lang="la">Pompeii</i></span>, and perhaps <span class="activity">(for the adventurous) an ascent of <span class="site">Mount Vesuvius</span></span>. Later in the period, the more adventurous, especially if provided with a <span class="transportation">yacht</span>, might attempt <span class="city">Sicily</span> to see its <span class="site">archeological sites</span>, <span class="site">volcanoes</span> and its <span class="site">baroque architecture</span>, <span class="city">Malta</span> or even <span class="country">Greece</span> itself. But <span class="city">Naples</span> &mdash; or later <i lang="la">Paestum</i> further south &mdash; was the usual terminus.
      </p>

      <p>
        Returning northward, the tourist might recross <span class="site">the Alps</span> to the German&ndash;speaking parts of Europe, visiting <span class="city">Innsbruck</span>, <span class="city">Vienna</span>, <span class="city">Dresden</span>, <span class="city">Berlin</span> and <span class="city">Potsdam</span>, with perhaps a period of <span class="activity">study at the universities</span> in <span class="city">Munich</span> or <span class="city">Heidelberg</span>. From there, travellers could visit <span class="country">Holland</span> and <span class="city">Flanders</span> (with more <span class="activity">gallery&ndash;going</span> and <span class="activity">art appreciation</span>) before returning across the <abbr title="English Channel" aria-label="English Channel">Channel</abbr> to <span class="country">England</span>.
