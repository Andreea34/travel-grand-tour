  <h1>Grand Tour</h1>
  <h3>A travel itinerary inspired by tourism in the 17th century.</h3>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>Travel dates back to antiquity where wealthy Greeks and Romans would travel for leisure to their summer homes and villas in cities such as <i lang="la" class="city">Pompeii</i> and <i lang="la" class="city">Baiae</i>. While early travel tended to be slower, more dangerous, and more dominated by trade and migration, cultural and technological advances over many years have tended to mean that travel has become easier and more accessible. Mankind has come a long way in transportation since Christopher Columbus sailed to the new world from <span class="country">Spain</span> in <time datetime="1492">1492</time>, an expedition which took over 10 weeks to arrive at the final destination; to <time datetime="2000">the 21st century</time> where aircraft allow travel from <span class="country">Spain</span> to the <span class="country">United States</span> overnight.</p>

  <p>Travel in <time datetime="1200">the Middle Ages</time> offered hardships and challenges, however it was important to the economy and to society. The wholesale sector depended (for example) on merchants dealing with/through caravans or sea&ndash;voyagers, end&ndash;user retailing often demanded the services of many itinerant peddlers wandering from village to hamlet, <dfn lang="fr">gyrovagues</dfn> (wandering monks) and wandering friars brought theology and pastoral support to neglected areas, traveling minstrels practiced the never&ndash;ending tour, and armies ranged far and wide in various crusades and in sundry other wars. Pilgrimages were common in both the European and Islamic world and involved streams of travelers both locally (<cite>Canterbury Tales</cite>&ndash;style) and internationally.</p>

  <p><strong>In <time datetime="1575">the late 16th century</time> it became fashionable for young European aristocrats and wealthy upper&ndash;class men to travel to significant European cities as part of their education in the arts and literature. This was known as the <dfn>Grand Tour</dfn>, and it included cities such as <span class="city">London</span>, <span class="city">Paris</span>, <span class="city">Venice</span>, <span class="city">Florence</span>, and <span class="city">Rome</span>.</strong></p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>The <dfn>Grand Tour</dfn> was the principally <time dateime="1600">17th</time> to early <time datetime="1800">19th century</time> custom of a traditional trip through Europe, with <span class="country">Italy</span> as a key destination, undertaken by upper&ndash;class young European men of sufficient means and rank (typically accompanied by a <dfn lang="en">chaperone</dfn>, such as a <span class="entourage chaperone">tutor</span> or <span class="entourage chaperone">family member</span>) when they had come of age (about 21 years old).</p>

  <p>The custom &mdash; which flourished from about <time datetime="1660">1660</time> until the advent of large&ndash;scale <span class="transportation">rail</span> transport in the <time datetime="1840">1840s</time> and was associated with a standard itinerary &mdash; served as an educational rite of passage. Though the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> was primarily associated with the British nobility and wealthy landed gentry, similar trips were made by wealthy young men of other Protestant Northern European nations, and from <time datetime="1750">the second half of the 18th century</time>, by some South and North Americans and Filipino <i lang="es-ES">Ilustrados</i>.</p>

  <p>By <time datetime="1750">the mid&ndash;18th century</time>, the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> had become a regular feature of aristocratic education in Central Europe as well, although it was restricted to the higher nobility. The tradition declined in Europe as enthusiasm for classical culture waned, and with the advent of accessible rail and <span class="transportation">steamship</span> travel &mdash; an era in which Thomas Cook made the <cite class="testimony source">Cook's Tour</cite> of early mass tourism a byword starting in <time datetime="1870">the 1870s</time>.</p>

  <p>However, with the rise of industrialization in the <span class="country">United States</span> in <time datetime="1800">the 19th century</time>, American Gilded Age <i lang="fr">nouveau riche</i> adopted the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> for both sexes and among those of more advanced years as a means of gaining both exposure and association with the sophistication of Europe. Even those of lesser means sought to mimic the pilgrimage, as satirized in <span class="testimonial author">Mark Twain</span>'s enormously popular <cite class="testimony source">Innocents Abroad</cite> in <time datetime="1869">1869</time>.</p>

  <p><strong>The primary value of the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> lay in its exposure to the cultural legacy of classical antiquity and the Renaissance, and to the aristocratic and fashionably polite society of the European continent.</strong> In addition, it provided the only opportunity to <span class="activity">view specific works of art</span>, and possibly the only chance to <span class="activity">hear certain music</span>.</p>

  <p>A <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> could last anywhere from several months to several years. It was commonly undertaken in the company of a <dfn lang="it" class="entourage guide">cicerone</dfn>, a knowledgeable guide or tutor.</p>

  <h2>History</h2>

  <p><span class="city">Rome</span> for many centuries had already been the destination of pilgrims, especially during Jubilee when European clergy visited the <span class="site">Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome</span>.</p>

  <p>In Britain, <span class="testimonial author">Thomas Coryat</span>'s travel book <cite class="testimony source">Coryat's Crudities</cite> (<time datetime="1611">1611</time>), published during the Twelve Years' Truce, was an early influence on the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> but it was the far more extensive tour through <span class="country">Italy</span> as far as <span class="city">Naples</span> undertaken by the 'Collector' Earl of Arundel, with his wife and children in <time datetime="1613">1613</time>&ndash;<time dateime="1614">14</time> that established the most significant precedent. This is partly because he asked Inigo Jones, not yet established as an architect but already known as a <i lang="en">great traveller</i> and masque designer, to act as his <dfn lang="it">cicerone</dfn> (guide).</p>

  <p>Larger numbers of tourists began their tours after the Peace of Münster in <time datetime="1648">1648</time>. According to the <cite>Oxford English Dictionary</cite>, the first recorded use of the term (perhaps its introduction to English) was by <span class="testimonial author">Richard Lassels</span> (c. <time datetime="1603">1603</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1668">1668</time>), an expatriate Roman Catholic priest, in his book <cite class="testimony source">The Voyage of Italy</cite>, which was published posthumously in <span class="city">Paris</span> in <time datetime="1670">1670</time> and then in <span class="city">London</span>. Lassels's introduction listed four areas in which travel furnished <q class="testimony quote">an accomplished, consummate Traveller</q>: the intellectual, the social, the ethical (by the opportunity of drawing moral instruction from all the traveller saw), and the political.</p>

  <p><strong>The idea of travelling for the sake of curiosity and learning was a developing idea in <time datetime="1600">the 17th century</time>.</strong></p>

  <p>As a young man at the outset of his account of a repeat <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i>, the historian <span class="testimonial author">Edward Gibbon</span> remarked that <q class="testimony quote">According to the law of custom, and perhaps of reason, foreign travel completes the education of an English gentleman.</q> Consciously adapted for intellectual self&ndash;improvement, Gibbon was <q class="testimony quote">revisiting the Continent on a larger and more liberal plan</q>; most <i lang="en">Grand Tourists</i> did not pause more than briefly in <span class="site">libraries</span>. On the eve of the Romantic era, he played a significant part in introducing <span class="testimonial author">William Beckford</span> wrote a vivid account of his <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> that made Gibbon's unadventurous Italian tour look distinctly conventional.</p>

  <p><strong>The typical <time datetime="1700">18th century</time> stance was that of the studious observer travelling through foreign lands <span class="activity">reporting his findings on human nature</span> for those unfortunates who stayed at home. Recounting one's observations to society at large to increase its welfare was considered an obligation; the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> flourished in this mindset.</strong></p>

  <p>In essence, the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> was neither a scholarly pilgrimage nor a religious one, though a pleasurable stay in <span class="city">Venice</span> and a residence in <span class="city">Rome</span> were essential. Catholic <i lang="en">Grand Tourists</i> followed the same routes as Protestant Whigs. Since <time datetime="1600">the 17th century</time>, a tour to such places was also considered essential for budding artists to understand proper <span class="activity">painting</span> and <span class="activity">sculpture</span> techniques</span>, though the trappings of the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> &mdash; <span class="entourage staff">valets</span> and <span class="entourage staff">coachmen</span>, perhaps a <span class="entourage staff">cook</span>, certainly a "<dfn class="entourage guide">bear&ndash;leader</dfn>" or scholarly guide &mdash; were beyond their reach.</p>

  <p>The advent of popular guides, such as the book <cite class="testimony source">An Account of Some of the Statues, Bas&ndash;Reliefs, Drawings, and Pictures in Italy</cite> published in <time datetime="1722">1722</time> by <span class="testimonial author">Jonathan Richardson and his son Jonathan Richardson the Younger</span>, did much to popularise such trips, and following the artists themselves, the elite considered travel to such centres as necessary rites of passage. For gentlemen, some works of art were essential to demonstrate the breadth and polish they had received from their tour.</p>

  <p><strong>The <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> offered a liberal education, and the opportunity to <span class="activity">acquire things otherwise unavailable</span>, lending an air of accomplishment and prestige to the traveller.</strong> <i lang="en">Grand Tourists</i> would return with crates full of <span class="souvenir">books</span>, <span class="souvenir">works of art</span>, <span class="souvenir">scientific instruments</span>, and cultural artefacts &mdash; from <span class="souvenir">snuff boxes</span> and <span class="souvenir">paperweights</span> to <span class="souvenir">altars</span>, <span class="souvenir">fountains</span>, and <span class="souvenir">statuary</span> &mdash; to be displayed in libraries, cabinets, gardens, drawing rooms, and galleries built for that purpose. The trappings of the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i>, especially <span class="souvenir activity">portraits of the traveller painted in continental settings</span>, became the obligatory emblems of worldliness, gravitas and influence. Artists who particularly thrived on the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> market included Carlo Maratti, who was first patronised by John Evelyn as early as <time datetime="1645">1645</time>, Pompeo Batoni the portraitist, and the <i lang="it">vedutisti</i> such as Canaletto, Pannini and Guardi. The less well&ndash;off could return with an <span class="souvenir">album of Piranesi etchings</span>.</p>

  <p>The <q class="testimony quote">perhaps</q> in Gibbon's opening remark cast an ironic shadow over his resounding statement. Critics of the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> derided its lack of adventure. <q class="testimony quote">The tour of Europe is a paltry thing</q>, said one <time dateime="1700">18th century</time> critic, <q class="testimony quote">a tame, uniform, unvaried prospect</q>. The <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> was said to reinforce the old preconceptions and prejudices about national characteristics, as Jean Gailhard's <cite class="testimony source">Compleat Gentleman</cite> (<time datetime="1678">1678</time>) observes: <q class="testimony quote">French courteous. Spanish lordly. Italian amorous. German clownish.</q> The deep suspicion with which the <i lang="en">Tour</i> was viewed at home in <span class="country">England</span>, where it was feared that the very experiences that completed the British gentleman might well undo him, were epitomised in the sarcastic nativist view of the ostentatiously <q class="testimony quote">well&ndash;travelled</q> <i lang="it">maccaroni</i> of the <time datetime="1760">1760s</time> and <time datetime="1770">1770s</time>.</p>

  <p><strong>Also worth noticing is that the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> not only fostered stereotypes of the countries visited but also led to a dynamic of contrast between northern and southern Europe.</strong> By constantly depicting <span class="country">Italy</span> as a <q class="testimony quote">picturesque place</q>, the travellers also unconsciously degraded <span class="country">Italy</span> as a place of backwardness. This unconscious degradation is best reflected in the famous verses of <span class="testimonial author">Lamartine</span> in which <span class="country">Italy</span> is depicted as a <q class="testimony quote">land of the past... where everything sleeps.</q></p>

  <p>In <span class="city">Rome</span>, antiquaries like Thomas Jenkins were also dealers and were able to sell and advise on the purchase of <span class="souvenir">marbles</span>; their price would rise if it were known that the <i lang="en">Tourists</i> were interested. <span class="souvenir">Coins</span> and <span class="souvenir">medals, which formed more portable souvenirs and a respected gentleman's guide to ancient history were also popular. Pompeo Batoni made a career of painting the English <i lang="it">milordi</i> posed with graceful ease among <span class="souvenir">Roman antiquities</span>. Many continued on to <span class="city">Naples</span>, where they also viewed <span class="city">Herculaneum</span> and <span class="city">Pompeii</span>, but few ventured far into Southern Italy, and fewer still to <span class="country">Greece</span>, then still under Turkish rule.</p>

  <p><strong>After the advent of steam&ndash;powered transportation around <time datetime="1825">1825</time>, the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> custom continued, but it was of a qualitative difference &mdash; cheaper to undertake, safer, easier, open to anyone.</strong> During much of <time datetime="1800">the 19th century</time>, most educated young men of privilege undertook the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i>. <span class="country">Germany</span> and <span class="country">Switzerland</span> came to be included in a more broadly defined circuit. Later, it became fashionable for young women as well; a trip to <span class="country">Italy</span>, with a <span class="entourage chaperone">spinster aunt</span> as chaperone, was part of the upper&ndash;class women's education, as in E. M. Forster's novel <cite>A Room with a View</cite>.</p>

  <p>British travellers were far from alone on the roads of Europe. On the contrary, <strong>from the <time datetime="1550">mid&ndash;16th century</time>, the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> was established as an ideal way to finish off the education of young men in countries such as <span class="country">Denmark</span>, <span class="country">France</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span>, the <span class="country">Netherlands</span>, <span class="country">Poland</span> and <span class="country">Sweden</span>.</strong> In spite of this the bulk of research conducted on the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> has been on British travellers. Dutch scholar Frank&ndash;van Westrienen Anna has made note of this historiographic focus, claiming that the scholarly understanding of the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> would have been more complex if more comparative studies had been carried out on continental travellers.</p>

  <p>Recent scholarship on the Swedish aristocracy has demonstrated that Swedish aristocrats, though being relatively poorer than their British peers, from around <time datetime="1620">1620</time> and onwards in many ways acted as their British counterparts. After studies at one or two <span class="site">renowned universities</span>, preferably those of <span class="city">Leiden</span> and <span class="city">Heidelberg</span>, the Swedish grand tourists set off to <span class="country">France</span> and <span class="country">Italy</span>, where they spent time in <span class="city">Paris</span>, <span class="city">Rome</span> and <span class="city">Venice</span> and completed the original <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> on the <span class="site">French countryside</span>. King Gustav III of Sweden made his <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> in <time datetime="1783">1783</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1784">84</time>.</p>

  <h2>Typical Itinerary</h2>

  <p>The itinerary of the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> was not set in stone, but was subject to innumerable variations, depending on an individual's interests and finances, though <span class="city">Paris</span> and <span class="city">Rome</span> were popular destinations for most English tourists. The most common itinerary of the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> shifted across generations, but the British tourist usually began in <span class="city">Dover</span>, <span class="country">England</span>, and crossed the English Channel to <span class="city">Ostend</span> in <span class="country">Belgium</span>, or to <span class="city">Calais</span> or <span class="city">Le Havre</span> in <span class="country">France</span>. From there, the tourist &mdash; usually accompanied by a tutor (known colloquially as a "bear&ndash;leader") and, if wealthy enough a troop of servants &mdash; could rent or acquire a <span class="transportation">coach</span> (which could be resold in any city &mdash; as in Giacomo Casanova's travels &mdash; or disassembled and packed across <span class="site">the Alps</span>), or he could opt to make the trip by <span class="transportation">riverboat</span> as far as <span class="site">the Alps</span>, either travelling up <span class="site">the Seine</span> to <span class="city">Paris</span>, or up <span class="site">the Rhine</span> to <span class="city">Basel</span>.</p>

  <p>Upon hiring a French&ndash;speaking guide, as <span class="language">French</span> was the dominant language of the elite in Europe during the <time datetime="1600">17th</time> and <time datetime="1700">18th centuries</time>, the tourist and his <i lang="fr">entourage</i> would travel to <span class="city">Paris</span>. There the traveller might undertake <span class="activity">lessons in French</span>, <span class="activity">dancing</span>, <span class="activity">fencing</span>, and <span class="activity">riding</span>. The appeal of <span class="city">Paris</span> lay in the sophisticated language and manners of French high society, including courtly behavior and fashion. This served to polish the young man's manners in preparation for a leadership position at home, often in government or diplomacy.</p>

  <p>From <span class="city">Paris</span> he would typically sojourn in urban <span class="country">Switzerland</span>, often in <span class="city">Geneva</span> (the cradle of the Protestant Reformation) or <span class="city">Lausanne</span>. <dfn class="activity">Alpinism</dfn> or mountaineering developed later, in the <time datetime="1800">19th century</time>. From there the traveller would endure a difficult crossing over <span class="site">the Alps</span> (such as at <span class="site">the Great St Bernard Pass</span>), which required dismantling the <span class="transportation">carriage</span> and larger luggage. If wealthy enough, he might be <span class="transportation">carried over the hard terrain</span> by <span class="entourage staff">servants</span>.</p>

  <p>Once in <span class="country">Italy</span>, the tourist would visit <span class="city">Turin</span> (and sometimes <span class="city">Milan</span>), then might spend a few months in <span class="city">Florence</span>, where there was a considerable Anglo&ndash;Italian society accessible to travelling Englishmen "of quality" and where the <i lang="it">Tribuna</i> of the <span class="site">Uffizi gallery</span> brought together in one space the monuments of High Renaissance paintings and Roman sculpture. After a side trip to <span class="city">Pisa</span>, the tourist would move on to <span class="city">Padua</span>, <span class="city">Bologna</span>, and <span class="city">Venice</span>. The British idea of <span class="city">Venice</span> as the <q class="testimony quote">locus of decadent Italianate allure</q> made it an epitome and cultural set piece of the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i>.</p>

  <p>From <span class="city">Venice</span> the traveller went to <span class="city">Rome</span> to <span class="activity">study the ancient ruins</span> and the masterpieces of painting, sculpture, and architecture of Rome's Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque periods. Some travellers also visited <span class="city">Naples</span> to <span class="activity">study music</span>, and (after <time datetime="1750">the mid&ndash;18th century</time>) to appreciate the recently discovered archaeological sites of <span class="city"><i lang="la">Herculaneum</i></span> and <span class="city"><i lang="la">Pompeii</i></span>, and perhaps (for the adventurous) an ascent of <span class="site">Mount Vesuvius</span>. Later in the period, the more adventurous, especially if provided with a <span class="transportation">yacht</span>, might attempt <span class="city">Sicily</span> to see its <span class="site">archeological sites</span>, <span class="site">volcanoes</span> and its <span class="site">baroque architecture</span>, <span class="city">Malta</span> or even <span class="country">Greece</span> itself. But <span class="city">Naples</span> &mdash; or later <i lang="la">Paestum</i> further south &mdash; was the usual terminus.</p>

  <p>Returning northward, the tourist might recross <span class="site">the Alps</span> to the German&ndash;speaking parts of Europe, visiting <span class="city">Innsbruck</span>, <span class="city">Vienna</span>, <span class="city">Dresden</span>, <span class="city">Berlin</span> and <span class="city">Potsdam</span>, with perhaps a period of study at the universities in <span class="city">Munich</span> or <span class="city">Heidelberg</span>. From there, travellers could visit <span class="country">Holland</span> and <span class="city">Flanders</span> (with more <span class="activity">gallery&ndash;going</span> and <span class="activity">art appreciation</span>) before returning across the <abbr title="English Channel" aria-label="English Channel">Channel</abbr> to <span class="country">England</span>.</p>

  <h2>Published Accounts</h2>

  <p>Published accounts of the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> provided illuminating detail and an often polished first&ndash;hand perspective of the experience. Examining some accounts offered by authors in their own lifetimes, <span class="testimonial author">Jeremy Black</span> detects the element of literary artifice in these and cautions that they should be approached as travel literature rather than unvarnished accounts. He lists as examples <span class="testimonial author">Joseph Addison</span>, <span class="testimonial author">John Andrews</span>, <span class="testimonial author">William Thomas Beckford</span> (whose <cite class="testimony source">Dreams, Waking Thoughts, and Incidents</cite> was a published account of his letters back home in <time datetime="1780">1780</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1781">1781</time>, embellished with stream&ndash;of&ndash;consciousness associations), <span class="testimonial author">William Coxe</span>, <span class="testimonial author">Elizabeth Craven</span>, <span class="testimonial author">John Moore</span>, tutor to successive dukes of Hamilton, <span class="testimonial author">Samuel Jackson Pratt</span>, <span class="testimonial author">Tobias Smollett</span>, <span class="testimonial author">Philip Thicknesse</span>, and <span class="testimonial author">Arthur Young</span>.</p>

  <p>Although <span class="country">Italy</span> was written as the <q class="testimony quote">sink of iniquity</q>, many travelers were not kept from recording the activities they participated in or the people they met, especially the women they encountered. To the <i lang="en">Grand Tourists</i>, <span class="country">Italy</span> was an unconventional country, for <q class="testimonial quote">The shameless women of Venice made it unusual, in its own way.</q> <span class="testimonial author">Sir James Hall</span> confided in his written diary to comment on seeing <q class="testimonial quote">more handsome women this day than I ever saw in my life</q>, also noting <q class="testimonial quote">how flattering Venetian dress [was] &mdash; or perhaps the lack of it</q>.</p>

  <p><time datetime="1700">Eighteenth</time> and <time datetime="1800">nineteenth century</time> Italian women, with their unfamiliar methods and routines, were opposites to the western dress expected of European women in the <time datetime="1700">eighteenth</time> and <time datetime="1800">nineteenth century</time>; their "foreign" ways led to the documentation of encounters with them, providing published accounts of the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="testimonial author">James Boswell</span> courted noble ladies and recorded his progress with his relationships, mentioning that Madame Micheli <q class="testimonial quote">Talked of religion, philosophy... Kissed hand often.</q> The promiscuity of Boswell's encounters with Italian elite are shared in his diary and provide further detail on events that occurred during the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i>. Boswell notes <q class="testimonial quote">Yesterday morning with her. Pulled up petticoat and showed whole knees... Touched with her goodness. All other liberties exquisite.</q> He describes his time with the Italian women he encounters and shares a part of history in his written accounts.</p>

  <p><span class="testimonial author">Lord Byron</span>'s letters to his mother with the accounts of his travels have also been published. Byron spoke of his first enduring Venetian love, his landlord's wife, mentioning that he has <q class="testimonial quote">fallen in love with a very pretty Venetian of two and twenty — with great black eyes — she is married &mdash; and so am I &mdash; we have found & sworn an eternal attachment... & I am more in love than ever... and I verily believe we are one of the happiest unlawful couples on this side of the Alps.</q> Many tourists enjoyed sexual relations while abroad but to a great extent were well behaved, such as <span class="testimonial author">Thomas Pelham</span>, and scholars such as <span class="testimonial author">Richard Pococke</span>, who wrote lengthy letters of their <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> experiences.</p>

  <p>Inventor <span class="testimonial author">Sir Francis Ronalds</span>' journals and sketches of his <time datetime="1818">1818</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1820">20</time> tour to Europe and the Near East have been published online. The letters written by sisters Mary and Ida Saxton of Canton, Ohio in <time datetime="1869">1869</time> while on a six&ndash;month tour offer insight into the <i lang="en">Grand Tour</i> tradition from an American perspective.</p>

  <p>Immediately following the American Civil War U.S. author and humorist <span class="testimonial author">Mark Twain</span> undertook a decidedly modest yet greatly aspiring "<i lang="en">grand tour</i>" of Europe, the Middle East, and the Holy Land, which he chronicled in his highly popular satire <cite class="testimony source">Innocents Abroad</cite> in <time datetim="1867">1867</time>. Not only was it the best&ndash;selling of Twain's works during his lifetime, it became one of the best&ndash;selling travel books of all time.</p>
