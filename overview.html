          The <dfn>Grand Tour</dfn> was the principally <time datetime="1600">17th</time> to early <time datetime="1800">19th century</time> custom of a traditional trip through Europe, with <span class="country">Italy</span> as a key destination, undertaken by upper&ndash;class young European men of sufficient means and rank (typically accompanied by a <dfn>chaperone</dfn>, such as a <span class="entourage chaperone">tutor</span> or <span class="entourage chaperone">family member</span>) when they had come of age (about 21 years old).

        <h3 class="subtitle">Social Context</h3>
        <p>
          The custom &mdash; which flourished from about <time datetime="1660">1660</time> until the advent of large&ndash;scale <span class="transportation">rail</span> transport in the <time datetime="1840">1840s</time> and was associated with a standard itinerary &mdash; served as an educational rite of passage. Though the <em>Grand Tour</em> was primarily associated with the British nobility and wealthy landed gentry, similar trips were made by wealthy young men of other Protestant Northern European nations, and from <time datetime="1750">the second half of the 18th century</time>, by some South and North Americans and Filipino <i lang="es-ES">Ilustrados</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          By <time datetime="1750">the mid&ndash;18th century</time>, the <em>Grand Tour</em> had become a regular feature of aristocratic education in Central Europe as well, although it was restricted to the higher nobility. The tradition declined in Europe as enthusiasm for classical culture waned, and with the advent of accessible rail and <span class="transportation">steamship</span> travel &mdash; an era in which Thomas Cook made the <cite class="publication">Cook's Tour</cite> of early mass tourism a byword starting in <time datetime="1870">the 1870s</time>.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, with the rise of industrialization in the <span class="country">United States</span> in <time datetime="1800">the 19th century</time>, American Gilded Age <i lang="fr">nouveau riche</i> adopted the <em>Grand Tour</em> for both sexes and among those of more advanced years as a means of gaining both exposure and association with the sophistication of Europe. Even those of lesser means sought to mimic the pilgrimage, as satirized in <span class="author">Mark Twain</span>'s enormously popular <cite class="publication">Innocents Abroad</cite> in <time datetime="1869">1869</time>.

          <p>
            <strong>The primary value of the <em>Grand Tour</em> lay in its exposure to the cultural legacy of classical antiquity and the Renaissance, and to the aristocratic and fashionably polite society of the European continent.</strong> In addition, it provided the only opportunity to <span class="activity">view specific works of art</span>, and possibly the only chance to <span class="activity">hear certain music</span>.

          A <em>Grand Tour</em> could last anywhere from several <em>months</em> to several <em>years</em>. It was commonly undertaken in the company of a <dfn lang="it" class="entourage guide">cicerone</dfn>, a knowledgeable guide or tutor.
