          <span class="city">Rome</span> for many centuries had already been the destination of pilgrims, especially during Jubilee when European clergy visited the <span class="site">Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome</span>.

          In Britain, <span class="author">Thomas Coryat</span>'s travel book <cite class="publication">Coryat's Crudities</cite> (<time datetime="1611">1611</time>), published during the Twelve Years' Truce, was an early influence on the <em>Grand Tour</em> but it was the far more extensive tour through <span class="country">Italy</span> as far as <span class="city">Naples</span> undertaken by the 'Collector' Earl of Arundel, with his wife and children in <time datetime="1613">1613</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1614">14</time> that established the most significant precedent. This is partly because he asked Inigo Jones, not yet established as an <span class="entourage guide">architect</span> but already known as a <em>"great traveller"</em> and masque designer, to act as his <dfn lang="it" class="entourage guide">cicerone</dfn> (guide).
        </p>
        <p>
          Larger numbers of tourists began their tours after the Peace of MÃ¼nster in <time datetime="1648">1648</time>. According to the <cite class="publication">Oxford English Dictionary</cite>, the first recorded use of the term (perhaps its introduction to English) was by <span class="author">Richard Lassels</span> (c. <time datetime="1603">1603</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1668">1668</time>), an expatriate Roman Catholic <span class="entourage guide">priest</span>, in his book <cite class="publication">The Voyage of Italy</cite>, which was published posthumously in <span class="city">Paris</span> in <time datetime="1670">1670</time> and then in <span class="city">London</span>. Lassels's introduction listed four areas in which travel furnished <em>"an accomplished, consummate Traveller"</em>: the intellectual, the social, the ethical (by the opportunity of drawing moral instruction from all the traveller saw), and the political.

        <p class="frame">
          <strong>The idea of travelling for the sake of curiosity and learning was a developing idea in <time datetime="1600">the 17th century</time>.</strong>

        <p>
          As a young man at the outset of his account of a repeat <em>Grand Tour</em>, the historian <span class="author">Edward Gibbon</span> remarked that, <blockquote class="quote">"According to the law of custom, and perhaps of reason, foreign travel completes the education of an English gentleman".</blockquote> Consciously adapted for intellectual self&ndash;improvement, Gibbon was <q>"revisiting the Continent on a larger and more liberal plan"</q>; most <em>Grand Tourists</em> did not pause more than briefly in <span class="site">libraries</span>. On the eve of the Romantic era, he played a significant part in introducing <span class="author">William Beckford</span> wrote a vivid account of his <em>Grand Tour</em> that made Gibbon's unadventurous Italian tour look distinctly conventional.

          <strong>The typical <time datetime="1700">18th century</time> stance was that of the studious observer travelling through foreign lands <span class="activity">reporting his findings on human nature for those unfortunates who stayed at home</span>. Recounting one's observations to society at large to increase its welfare was considered an obligation; the <em>Grand Tour</em> flourished in this mindset.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In essence, the <em>Grand Tour</em> was neither a scholarly pilgrimage nor a religious one, though a pleasurable stay in <span class="city">Venice</span> and a residence in <span class="city">Rome</span> were essential. Catholic <em>Grand Tourists</em> followed the same routes as Protestant Whigs. Since <time datetime="1600">the 17th century</time>, a tour to such places was also considered essential for budding artists to understand proper <span class="activity">painting</span> and <span class="activity">sculpture</span> techniques, though the trappings of the <em>Grand Tour</em> &mdash; <span class="entourage staff">valets</span> and <span class="entourage staff">coachmen</span>, perhaps a <span class="entourage staff">cook</span>, certainly a <dfn class="entourage guide">bear&ndash;leader</dfn> or <span class="entourage guide">scholarly guide</span> &mdash; were beyond their reach.
        </p>
        <p>
          The advent of popular guides, such as the book <cite class="publication">An Account of Some of the Statues, Bas&ndash;Reliefs, Drawings, and Pictures in Italy</cite> published in <time datetime="1722">1722</time> by <span class="author">Jonathan Richardson and his son Jonathan Richardson the Younger</span>, did much to popularise such trips, and following the artists themselves, the elite considered travel to such centres as necessary rites of passage. For gentlemen, some works of art were essential to demonstrate the breadth and polish they had received from their tour.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class="frame">The <em>Grand Tour</em> offered a liberal education, and the opportunity to <span class="activity">acquire things otherwise unavailable</span>, lending an air of accomplishment and prestige to the traveller.</strong> <em>Grand Tourists</em> would return with crates full of <span class="souvenir">books</span>, <span class="souvenir">works of art</span>, <span class="souvenir">scientific instruments</span>, and cultural artefacts &mdash; from <span class="souvenir">snuff boxes</span> and <span class="souvenir">paperweights</span> to <span class="souvenir">altars</span>, <span class="souvenir">fountains</span>, and <span class="souvenir">statuary</span> &mdash; to be displayed in libraries, cabinets, gardens, drawing rooms, and galleries built for that purpose. The trappings of the <em>Grand Tour</em>, especially <span class="souvenir">portraits of the traveller painted in continental settings</span>, became the obligatory emblems of worldliness, gravitas and influence. Artists who particularly thrived on the <em>Grand Tour</em> market included Carlo Maratti, who was first patronised by John Evelyn as early as <time datetime="1645">1645</time>, Pompeo Batoni the portraitist, and the <i lang="it">vedutisti</i> such as Canaletto, Pannini and Guardi. The less well&ndash;off could return with an <span class="souvenir">album of Piranesi etchings</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <q>"perhaps"</q> in Gibbon's opening remark cast an ironic shadow over his resounding statement. Critics of the <em>Grand Tour</em> derided its lack of adventure. <blockquote><q class="quote">"The tour of Europe is a paltry thing"</q>, said one <time datetime="1700">18th century</time> critic, <q class="quote">"a tame, uniform, unvaried prospect"</q>.</blockquote> The <em>Grand Tour</em> was said to reinforce the old preconceptions and prejudices about national characteristics, as <span class="author">Jean Gailhard</span>'s <cite class="publication">Compleat Gentleman</cite> (<time datetime="1678">1678</time>) observes: <blockquote class="quote">"French courteous. Spanish lordly. Italian amorous. German clownish."</blockquote> The deep suspicion with which the <abbr title="Grand Tour">Tour</abbr> was viewed at home in <span class="country">England</span>, where it was feared that the very experiences that completed the British gentleman might well undo him, were epitomised in the sarcastic nativist view of the ostentatiously <q>"well&ndash;travelled <i lang="it">maccaroni</i>"</q> of the <time datetime="1760">1760s</time> and <time datetime="1770">1770s</time>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class="frame">Also worth noticing is that the <em>Grand Tour</em> not only fostered stereotypes of the countries visited but also led to a dynamic of contrast between northern and southern Europe.</strong> By constantly depicting <span class="country">Italy</span> as a <q>"picturesque place"</q>, the travellers also unconsciously degraded <span class="country">Italy</span> as a place of backwardness. This unconscious degradation is best reflected in the famous verses of <span class="author">Lamartine</span> in which <span class="country">Italy</span> is depicted as a <q>"land of the past... where everything sleeps."</q>
        </p>
        <p>
          In <span class="city">Rome</span>, antiquaries like Thomas Jenkins were also dealers and were able to sell and advise on the purchase of <span class="souvenir">marbles</span>; their price would rise if it were known that the <abbr title="Grand Tourists">Tourists</abbr> were interested. <span class="souvenir">Coins</span> and <span class="souvenir">medals</span>, which formed more portable souvenirs and a respected gentleman's guide to ancient history were also popular. Pompeo Batoni made a career of painting the English <i lang="it">milordi</i> posed with graceful ease among <span class="souvenir">Roman antiquities</span>. Many continued on to <span class="city">Naples</span>, where they also viewed <span class="city">Herculaneum</span> and <span class="city">Pompeii</span>, but few ventured far into Southern Italy, and fewer still to <span class="country">Greece</span>, then still under Turkish rule.

          <strong class="frame">After the advent of <span class="transportation">steam&ndash;powered transportation</span> around <time datetime="1825">1825</time>, the <em>Grand Tour</em> custom continued, but it was of a qualitative difference &mdash; cheaper to undertake, safer, easier, open to anyone.</strong> During much of <time datetime="1800">the 19th century</time>, most educated young men of privilege undertook the <em>Grand Tour</em>. <span class="country">Germany</span> and <span class="country">Switzerland</span> came to be included in a more broadly defined circuit. Later, it became fashionable for young women as well; a trip to <span class="country">Italy</span>, with a <span class="entourage chaperone">spinster aunt</span> as chaperone, was part of the upper&ndash;class women's education, as in <span class="author">E. M. Forster</span>'s novel <cite class="publication">A Room with a View</cite>.

        <p>
          British travellers were far from alone on the roads of Europe. On the contrary, from the <time datetime="1550">mid&ndash;16th century</time>, the <em>Grand Tour</em> was established as an ideal way to finish off the education of young men in countries such as <span class="country">Denmark</span>, <span class="country">France</span>, <span class="country">Germany</span>, the <span class="country">Netherlands</span>, <span class="country">Poland</span> and <span class="country">Sweden</span>. In spite of this the bulk of research conducted on the <em>Grand Tour</em> has been on British travellers. Dutch scholar <span class="author">Frank&ndash;van Westrienen Anna</span> has made note of this historiographic focus, claiming that the scholarly understanding of the <em>Grand Tour</em> would have been more complex if more comparative studies had been carried out on continental travellers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recent scholarship on the Swedish aristocracy has demonstrated that Swedish aristocrats, though being relatively poorer than their British peers, from around <time datetime="1620">1620</time> and onwards in many ways acted as their British counterparts. After studies at one or two <span class="site">renowned universities</span>, preferably those of <span class="city">Leiden</span> and <span class="city">Heidelberg</span>, the Swedish <em>Grand Tourists</em> set off to <span class="country">France</span> and <span class="country">Italy</span>, where they spent time in <span class="city">Paris</span>, <span class="city">Rome</span> and <span class="city">Venice</span> and completed the original <em>Grand Tour</em> on the <span class="site">French countryside</span>. King Gustav III of Sweden made his <em>Grand Tour</em> in <time datetime="1783">1783</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1784">84</time>.
