        <p>
          Published accounts of the <em>Grand Tour</em> provided illuminating detail and an often polished first&ndash;hand perspective of the experience. Examining some accounts offered by authors in their own lifetimes, <span class="author">Jeremy Black</span> detects the element of <em>literary artifice</em> in these and cautions that they should be approached as travel literature rather than unvarnished accounts. He lists as examples <span class="author">Joseph Addison</span>, <span class="author">John Andrews</span>, <span class="author">William Thomas Beckford</span> (whose <cite class="publication">Dreams, Waking Thoughts, and Incidents</cite> was a published account of his letters back home in <time datetime="1780">1780</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1781">1781</time>, embellished with stream&ndash;of&ndash;consciousness associations), <span class="author">William Coxe</span>, <span class="author">Elizabeth Craven</span>, <span class="author">John Moore</span>, tutor to successive dukes of Hamilton, <span class="author">Samuel Jackson Pratt</span>, <span class="author">Tobias Smollett</span>, <span class="author">Philip Thicknesse</span>, and <span class="author">Arthur Young</span>.

          <time datetime="1700">Eighteenth</time> and <time datetime="1800">nineteenth century</time> Italian women, with their unfamiliar methods and routines, were opposites to the western dress expected of European women in the <time datetime="1700">eighteenth</time> and <time datetime="1800">nineteenth century</time>; their <q>"foreign"</q> ways led to the documentation of encounters with them, providing published accounts of the <em>Grand Tour</em>.

        <p>
          <span class="author">James Boswell</span> <span class="activity">courted noble ladies and recorded his progress with his relationships</span>, mentioning that... <blockquote class="quote">"Madame Micheli talked of religion, philosophy... Kissed hand often."</blockquote> The promiscuity of Boswell's encounters with Italian elite are shared in his diary and provide further detail on events that occurred during the <em>Grand Tour</em>. Boswell notes, <blockquote class="quote">"Yesterday morning with her. Pulled up petticoat and showed whole knees... Touched with her goodness. All other liberties exquisite."</blockquote> He describes his time with the Italian women he encounters and shares a part of history in his written accounts.

          <span class="author">Lord Byron</span>'s letters to his mother with the accounts of his travels have also been published. Byron spoke of his first enduring Venetian love, his landlord's wife, mentioning that he has ...<blockquote class="quote">"... fallen in love with a very pretty Venetian of two and twenty — with great black eyes — she is married &mdash; and so am I &mdash; we have found & sworn an eternal attachment... & I am more in love than ever... and I verily believe we are one of the happiest unlawful couples on this side of <span class="site">the Alps</span>."</blockquote> Many tourists enjoyed sexual relations while abroad but to a great extent were well behaved, such as <span class="author">Thomas Pelham</span>, and scholars such as <span class="author">Richard Pococke</span>, who wrote lengthy letters of their <em>Grand Tour</em> experiences.

          Immediately following the American Civil War U.S. author and humorist <span class="author">Mark Twain</span> undertook a decidedly modest yet greatly aspiring <em>"grand tour"</em> of Europe, the Middle East, and the Holy Land, which he chronicled in his highly popular satire <cite class="publication">Innocents Abroad</cite> in <time datetime="1867">1867</time>. Not only was it the best&ndash;selling of Twain's works during his lifetime, it became one of the best&ndash;selling travel books of all time.
